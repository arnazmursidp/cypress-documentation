## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expecting to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/wiki/code-of-conduct).

## Getting Started

The documentation in this repo is generated using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

**Fork this repository**

Using GitHub, create a copy (a fork) of this repository under your personal account.

**Clone your forked repository**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your username>/cypress-documentation.git
cd cypress-documentation
```

**Install dependencies:**

**note:** at least Node 6 is required, but Node 8 with NPM v5 is preferred to take advantage of
the package lock file.

```bash
npm install
```

This will install this repo's direct dependencies.

**Then, build the `public` directory and start the app:**

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Visit [http://localhost:2222/](http://localhost:2222/).

**note** If you need to debug documentation build step run with environment
variable set `DEBUG=docs npm run build` 

## Writing Documentation

### Adding Examples

The documents outlining examples are within the [`source/examples`](/source/examples) directory. Each document is written in markdown with a little bit of [Hexo flair](https://hexo.io/docs/tag-plugins.html). To add an example to a document, just try to follow the formatting of any previous examples in the markdown file.

Add an associating image with the example within the [`source/img/examples`](/source/img/examples) directory. Each image should be resolution **715w x 480h**. Reference the image in the markdown document as follows:

```md
{% img /img/examples/name-of-file.jpg "alt text describing img" %}
```

## Commiting Code

### Linting

Danger ðŸ“›: because we are minifying client side code using a [Hexo plugin](https://github.com/mamboer/hexo-filter-cleanup) which in turn calls
`uglify`, the code should be strictly ES5. Thus everything inside the `theme` should be linted with ES5 settings and not upgraded to ES6.

### Pull Requests

You should push your local changes to your forked GitHub repository and then
open a pull request from your repo to the `cypress-io/cypress-documentation` repo.

- The pull request should be from your repository to the `develop` branch in `cypress-io/cypress-documentation`
- When opening a PR for a specific issue already open, please use the `address #[issue number]` or `closes #[issue number]` syntax in the pull request description.

### Contributor License Agreement

We use a [`cla-assistant.io`](https://cla-assistant.io/) web hook to make sure every contributor assigns the rights of their contribution to Cypress.io. If you want to read the CLA agreement, its text is in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/bahmutov/cf22bc6c6b55219d0f9a76d04981f7ae).

After making a [pull request](#pull-requests), the CLA assistant will add a review comment. Just click on the link and accept the CLA. That's it!

## Deployment

We will try to review and merge pull requests as fast as possible. After merging, we will deploy it to staging environment, run E2E tests (using Cypress itself of course), and then merge it into `master`, which will deploy it to the official [https://docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io) website. If you want to know our deploy process, read [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).
